# Active Context

## Current Focus
Fine-tuning animations and interactions across all implemented sections of the Home page, with specific attention to the 3D button effects, text reveal animations, and title scroll effects.

## Recent Changes
- Implemented WorkSection with project grid layout and hover animations
- Implemented BlogSection with horizontal text reveal effects
- Implemented ServiceSection with service cards and staggered animations
- Implemented TestimonialSection with statistics and testimonial content
- Created CTA Section with horizontal scrolling marquee text
- Developed reusable Button3D component with 3D flip animation
- Added custom Coolvetica font imports
- Implemented horizontal text reveal with gradient animation
- Fixed button animation with proper 3D rotation and transform-style
- Improved hero section title horizontal scroll animation 
- Created reusable HorizontalRevealText component for consistent animations
- Optimized 3D button hover state with improved color contrast

## Active Decisions
1. Using CSS transform-style: preserve-3d for 3D button effects
2. Implementing scroll-triggered animations with useInView from Framer Motion
3. Using HorizontalRevealText component for consistent text reveal effects
4. Managing gradient animations with motion.div and transform values
5. Setting up proper CSS organization to avoid style conflicts
6. Using requestAnimationFrame for smooth marquee animations
7. Adjusting title scroll range from [0, 0.25] to [0, 0.75] for smoother animation
8. Using `as const` type assertions for position properties to improve type safety
9. Applying namespace imports for React to follow TypeScript best practices

## Next Steps
1. Implement footer component
2. Create navigation component
3. Optimize animations for performance
4. Ensure responsiveness across all sections
5. Begin work on other pages (Works, Blog, Contact)

## Current Considerations
- Animation performance optimization, especially for lower-end devices
- Ensuring consistent animation timing and easing across components
- Maintaining proper z-index stacking for layered elements
- Button interaction states and accessibility
- Use of hardware acceleration with transform3d for smoother animations
- Optimizing animation frame rates with useTransform interpolation

## Open Questions
1. How to optimize the CTA marquee animation for better performance?
2. What approach to use for the navigation menu animations?
3. How to handle transitions between pages?
4. Best practices for lazy loading image assets?
5. How to ensure animations don't interfere with accessibility?

## Immediate Tasks
1. Finalize animation performance optimization
2. Complete font implementation and optimization
3. Optimize gradient text reveal animations
4. Begin footer component implementation
5. Implement navigation with proper animation states
