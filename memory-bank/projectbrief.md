# Digital Innovation Studio Website Replication

## Project Overview
This project aims to create a pixel-perfect replica of the Digital Innovation Studio website (https://digitalinnovation.studio) using React and modern web development practices.

## Core Requirements

### Pages to Implement
1. Home Page
2. Works Page
3. Blogs Listing Page
4. Contact Page

### Technical Requirements
- Built with React (not Next.js)
- TypeScript for type safety
- SCSS for styling
- Responsive design matching original breakpoints
- Animations and interactions matching original site
- Semantic HTML structure
- Modular component architecture

### Design Requirements
- Match all visual elements exactly
- Use same font families and sizes
- Maintain identical image ratios
- Replicate all animations and transitions
- Match responsive breakpoints
- Use placeholder data for dynamic content

### Code Quality Requirements
- Clear folder structure
- Reusable components
- SCSS/CSS modularization
- Proper code commenting
- Industry best practices
- No direct code copying from original site

## Project Goals
1. Create a maintainable and scalable codebase
2. Achieve pixel-perfect visual matching
3. Implement smooth animations and interactions
4. Ensure responsive behavior across all devices
5. Follow React best practices and patterns

## Technical Stack
- React with TypeScript
